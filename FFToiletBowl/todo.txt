1. we need a PassStop column for field position at end of pass play
2. X you need to match on "yard" and "yards" on the prepositions
3. WSH in schedule vs WAS in play by play text, means the field side isn't going to match
   - you may need to replace the field position column values with consistent ones, post-facto.
4. X Add "tackled by" parentoken followed at end of "for _ yards"
5. PENALTY
    this.IsPenaltyAccepted needs to be set to true, when it is accepted
6. Add "incomplete" as a adverb
   you also need .PassComplete column now.
7. rundirection/formation needs an event handler to populate "tackle/guard/end"
8. "Pass Caught At" is not a common value.  There needs to be a flag for it
9. PENALTY can follow time
   "(12:20 - 1st)  PENALTY on WAS-T.Williams, False Start, 5 yards, enforced at ARZ 30 - No Play."
10. after getting the above fixed, add DEBUG and reconstruct the line from it's parts.  if it doesn't match, then kick out to investigate

SKIPPING 
(13:56 - 1st)  M.Ryan pass deep left to J.Jones pushed ob at GB 28 for 19 yards (J.Alexander). 
Green Bay challenged the pass completion ruling, and the play was Upheld. 
The ruling on the field stands. (Timeout #2.)


... what im thinking about now, is that the unit test to rebuild the play, from parsed, takes a long time to write
    and quite frankly, might not be data relevant for this, but is ncessary to rebuild
    punting, the least interesting play, statistically, has as much, if not more, variations on the play, as a run or pass.
    yet fails the unit test at the highest /bc I don't want to build the damn test

...plus the weird plays have multiple sentences
   ... challenges
   ... laterals
   ... flea flickers
   These need to be accounted for, but are such a small amount of the sample

...plus injuries have a problem
...reporting to be eligible
   these are all multi-sentence plays, which are going to be a pain to re-build to for the test
 but we are at a 60% success parse rate.
   ...with punts failing, the ceiling is 75%, if you think about it.  4th downs are almost all untestable to see if it parsed correctly.

...[ ] sacks are not parsing correctly
...[ ] field goals are not parsing correctly
...[ ] we need to have multi-leg plays, multiple legs as different sentences
       each sentence has to have a detection
       how are we going to code termination of parsing at end of array
       how are we going identify each phrase type?
         esp if "runs" don't have the word run in it?
       parse should return a int of completed parsed.
       10 /11 means 11 tokens, 10 met the expectations
       1/11 means just one did, so we pick the highest score.
          pass will get zero because the first parse is always "pass"
          run will get like 10/11
          sack
       the problem with this approach is... the parse executes event handlers... if one was executed before, but future parsing evaluation is more appropriate, no way to rollback automaically.




parsing "to 50" is not working
